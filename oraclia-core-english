Oraclia · Core System

Minimal prototype of the Oraclia symbolic language.
This version defines the essential architecture of the system: the conceptual core, the basic functions of the symbols, and the rules that allow their structural use.

1. Conceptual Core

Oraclia is an structural, non-interpretative symbolic language.
The symbols do not carry psychological, spiritual, or cultural meaning: they operate purely as formal units that describe movements within a process.

The foundational principles are:

each symbol = one structural function

the full set = 21 fixed, non-expandable units

combinations = process sequences (not narratives, not mystical interpretations)

language use = reading states and transitions, not meanings

2. Symbol Functions (minimal definition)

This prototype includes only the minimal functional definitions required to establish the system:

∞ → open field, potential

† → reference point / orientation

◉ → focus

≋ → return

✧ → activation

▭ → limit

☲ → contrast

✛ → material / concrete

∆ → change

≈ → adjustment

⇡ → ascent / progress

→ → direction

⊘ → interruption

Y → bifurcation

≡ → synthesis

⇤ → withdrawal

() → literal data

〰 → cycle

? → indeterminacy

÷ → closure

○ → pause

These definitions are sufficient to identify the system’s functions without exposing the full model.

3. Formal Architecture of the Language

Closed system: only 21 stable symbols.

Defined functions: each symbol operates as a state or transition.

Controlled combination: sequences describe movement, not meaning.

Interpretive neutrality: the language does not perform predictions or personal readings.

Interoperability: symbols are Unicode, processable by both humans and AI systems.

This structure allows Oraclia to represent processes in personal, organizational, or computational contexts.

4. Scope of Use

The system can be used to:

describe phases of a process

identify structural transitions

represent internal movements of a situation

support clear communication between humans and AI systems

The system is not used for:

diagnostics

predictions

emotional interpretation

esoteric or symbolic readings

5. Prototype Status

This document constitutes the minimal verifiable prototype of the Oraclia system.
Its publication establishes precedence and authorship of the conceptual model.
