Oraclia Computational · Minimal Prototype

This repository contains the first computational prototype of Oraclia:
a symbolic process-language designed to detect and structure internal dynamics (doubt, direction, tension, closure, etc.) using a fixed set of 21 formal symbols.

This prototype does not implement Oraclia’s full logic.
It demonstrates a minimal and verifiable concept:

A short text → symbolic interpretation → structural output
using Oraclia’s fixed symbolic operators.

This makes it possible to test how Oraclia can act as an independent symbolic layer that could operate under any AI system.

1. Purpose of the Prototype

This pilot shows that Oraclia can function as a computational symbolic layer:

It takes a user input (a sentence about a situation, emotion, or process).

It maps the text to one or more symbolic process-states.

It returns a structured interpretation, not emotional, not predictive, and not psychological.

The goal is to demonstrate:

symbolic detection

structural mapping

minimal process reasoning

the potential for self-reflection, clarity, and decision-making support

This is not a traditional chatbot.
It is a symbolic operator, not an analytic conversational model.

2. What This Prototype Includes

✔ A minimal HTML + JavaScript demo
✔ A mapping between keywords and Oraclia's symbols
✔ A simple interpreter that returns a structural reading
✔ A working example of symbolic detection

This is only a proof of concept.
No logic or interpretation beyond the symbols is included.

3. How to Run the Demo
Option A — Open Locally

Download the file oraclia_computational_demo.html

Double-click to open it in any browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

Type a sentence into the field

The symbolic output will appear immediately

No installation is required.

Option B — Run on GitHub Pages (Recommended)

If you want this prototype to be accessible publicly:

Go to your repository

Open Settings → Pages

Under "Build and Deployment":

Source: Deploy from branch

Branch: main

Folder: /root (or wherever the HTML file is)

Save

GitHub will generate a public URL where the demo appears as a real webpage.

More components will be added as the system grows (symbol tables, operators, mapping rules, etc.).

5. Limitations of This Prototype

This demo is intentionally minimal:

no real language model

no advanced symbolic inference

no compound-sequence reasoning

no contextual weighting

no emotional interpretation

It only shows:

“Given a text input, Oraclia can operate as a symbolic classifier.”

This is the first computational evidence that Oraclia can function below any AI system as a symbolic, structural layer.
